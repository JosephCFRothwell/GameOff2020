Project initialisation hierarchy structure:

- Managers
- UI
- Cameras
- Lighting
- World
    - Scenery
    - Props
- _Runtime

Put all of these at 0,0,0 with default rotation and scale
When instantiating at runtime, put into _Runtime, not into others
For empty objects that are solely containers for scripts, use @ as a prefix, 
    EXCEPT for managers/controllers


    Use Manager_Control as the container for the top-level script which contains
    public variables other scripts rely on
