So I've got an idea done

For it I am gonna need:

- Platforming
- Cutscenes
- Looping parallax backgrounds
- Pixel art
- animations with that pixel art
- Time machine (only going backwards)
- Same "world" but with differences based on era
- Dialogue system
- Enemies (two main types, croissantinati and big egg)
- fight by throwing eggs
- get health back by eating cooked eggs and bacon
- lunar landing on the Big Egg at the end
- Music to play (several tracks needed)
- subtitle system (if possible do it CC)
- sfx
- graphics options
- save system (tie into ManagerIO)
- Title screen
- Credits
- Pause screen (allows loading and fiddling with options)
- UI (scales properly for various screen sizes)
- Linux build, test with ubuntu or something
- Mac build, if possible test with old laptop
