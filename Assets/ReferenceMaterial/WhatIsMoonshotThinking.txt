Moonshot Thinking is when we choose a huge problem, and propose to create a radical solution to the 
problem using disruptive technology. Also, a moonshot aims for a 10x impact on the problems, not 
just a 10% improvement.

What makes a great Moonshot?
-Clearly Defined Problem
-Radical Proposal to fix the problem
-Scientific Reason to believe it

What is a Moonshot mindset?
-It is about the quality of experiments not the quality of the outcome
-Embracing failure
-To make a ton of progress we have to go through a ton of failures
-Start from a plain sheet of paper
-Figure it as you go
-Believe
-No excuses
-Fail fast
