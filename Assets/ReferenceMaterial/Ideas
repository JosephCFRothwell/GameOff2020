-Clearly Defined Problem
        -At breakfast you dropped your eggs on the floor so couldn't have a proper English breakfast
        
-Radical Proposal to fix the problem
        - Build a time machine, go back in time to make leaders of the past invest in genetically
            modifying chickens so that eggs will have harder shells by breakfast
            
-Failures in your way
        - Big Egg (starts as a lobby group like big tobacco, but as you go further back it seems they
            worship a fragile god)
        - Croissantinati (illuminati, but favouring continental breakfasts)
        - You accidentally instigate wars which slow progress
        - Eventually you come to the question, what came first, chicken or the egg. Turns out it was the egg,
            and you need to go to the dawn of creation to fight Big Egg (actual big egg) that Big Egg worship,
            allowing Small Egg (which has a harder shell) to gain dominance.
                - The fight is a literal moonshot, you must land on Big Egg with a 1960s lunar lander
            
-Scientific Reason to believe it
        Futureproofing eggs, you could just buy more eggs, but what happens next time you drop them?
        

Other:
- There is a romeo and juliet situation between a boy from Big Egg and and a girl from the Croissantinati. 
            - You have the opportunity to save both of them, but the good end requires letting them die
                    because after all both are the enemies of a safe English breakfast
                    
- When the game is done, you go back to the present, everything is weird and different
(eg everything is written in weird script, your wife speaks different language and has cat ears,
your son is blue skinned, the houses outside are egg shaped, there is some weird army unit
marching down the street, but you don't care, because you can sit down and have a proper breakfast
